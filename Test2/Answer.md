# Pass by Value Vs Pass by Reference in Js

**Pass by Value:** When you pass a variable by value, a copy of the variable's value is passed to the function. This means that changes to the variable inside the function do not affect the original variable.

**Pass by Reference:** When you pass a variable by reference, a reference to the variable's memory address is passed to the function. This means that changes to the variable inside the function affect the original variable
